~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RUNNING THE FILE:
Run the executable .jar file included in the project folder using the following command: 
java -jar sort.jar -f"FILENAME.txt" -T[v/h/a] -S[b/s/i/m/q/z]

Enter one of the options for each argument. -T(type) is followed by v(volume), h(height), or a(base area) 
and -S(sort) is followed by b(bubble), s(selection), i(insertion), m(merge), q(quicksort), or z(pancake).

"FILENAME.txt" should be replaced with the relative path for the text file that you are sorting. The quotation marks are optional.

All of these letters are case-insensitive, and the three arguments can be written in any order. If the arguments are entered 
incorrectly, there will be an error and a formatting reminder guide will be displayed.

If the program is run successfully, the system will print out the first, last, and every 1000th item in the list, as well as total running time.

Note that items will be sorted in descending order.
